# Avent Of Code - 2022

My attempt at the annual AoC event. Decided to try as many programming languages as possible even though I probably won't be able to use a new one for all the 25 days. No refactoring during coding, might possibly add other language imolementations and refactored versions.

- [Day 1](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/01): Used Python, probably going to rewrite it to something else so I can use Python for one of the more difficult tasks.
- [Day 2](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/02): MSSQL because task seemed fairly easy and quite doable in SQL
- [Day 3](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/03): Wanted to use new programming languages at simpler tasks, picked Go. Fairly easy, not too fond of Go so far.
- [Day 4](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/04): Picked C++, developer experience was pretty miserable, used to programming language incorrectly and missed a lot of utility functions. This task would be super easy with something like Python.
- [Day 5](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/05): Seemed relatively hard, so I decided to pick Java, thinking it would be similar to C#. The whole process was tragic and not enjoyable at all. Would not do again.
- [Day 6](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/06): Wanted to try Rust, was not too bad, even though I used to language incorrectly. Task itself was really easy.
- [Day 7](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/07): Task looked rather hard, decided to pick C# (my most used BE language). Missread the task and was solving a much more difficult task, thinking it's a variation of the knapsack puzzle. Only after several hours I reread the task and solved it in few minutes.
- [Day 8](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/08): Welcome to City of Ugly Code. Not too difficult task, decided to go with JS. Was fun to do, results in a ton of copy pasted unoptimized chaotic code that just works.
- [Day 9](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/09): Fun one! Seemed fairly difficult from start. Picked Typescript because it's one of the languages I feel comfortable with. Quality of the code is absolutely horrible but managed quite quickly.
- [Day 10](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/10): I'm an idiot! Task was rather easy but I made so many by one mistakes that I brute forced by some weird indexing. Spent so much time on this one. Done in Dart, quite enjoyable experience.
- [Day 11](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/11): Slight delay, going to try catching up. For this I picked Ruby as it was one of the larger Object oriented programming languages I had left. Everything went smoothly except some problems with manipulating an array while iterating over it. Second part took me fairly long time, couldn't think of right math to deal with the 2nd problem. Overall pleasant first Ruby experience.
