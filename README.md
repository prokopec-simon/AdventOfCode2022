# Avent Of Code - 2022
My attempt at the annual AoC event. Decided to try as many programming languages as possible even though I probably won't be able to use a new one for all the 25 days. No refactoring during coding, might possibly add other language imolementations and refactored versions. 
- [Day 1](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/01): Used Python, probably going to rewrite it to something else so I can use Python for one of the more difficult tasks.
- [Day 2](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/02): MSSQL because task seemed fairly easy and quite doable in SQL
- [Day 3](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/03): Wanted to use new programming languages at simpler tasks, picked Go. Fairly easy, not too fond of Go so far.
- [Day 4](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/04): Picked C++, developer experience was pretty miserable, used to programming language incorrectly and missed a lot of utility functions. This task would be super easy with something like Python.
- [Day 5](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/05): Seemed relatively hard, so I decided to pick Java, thinking it would be similar to C#. The whole process was tragic and not enjoyable at all. Would not do again.
- [Day 6](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/06): Wanted to try Rust, was not too bad, even though I used to language incorrectly. Task itself was really easy.
- [Day 7](https://github.com/prokopec-simon/AdventOfCode2022/tree/master/07): Task looked rather hard, decided to pick C# (my most used BE language). Missread the task and was solving a much more difficult task, thinking it's a variation of the knapsack puzzle. Only after several hours I reread the task and solved it in few minutes.
